🔧 Required Modifications
1. Classification Type - CRITICAL CHANGE
❌ Remove: Multi-class classification (normal, early, moderate, severe, critical)
✅ Change to: Binary classification (Glaucoma vs Normal)
Reason: Dataset has only 2 folders (glaucoma/normal), not 5 classes
2. Kagglehub Integration
❌ Remove: Kagglehub integration
✅ Change to: Direct folder loading from "Fundus_Scanes_Sorted/Train" and "Fundus_Scanes_Sorted/Validation"
Reason: Dataset is already downloaded with Train/Validation structure
3. Train/Validation/Test Split
❌ Remove: Creating train/validation/test split from scratch
✅ Change to: Use existing Train folder as-is, split Validation folder into Val (50%) + Test (50%)
Reason: Dataset already has Train/Validation separation
4. Severity Levels Approach
❌ Remove: Direct multi-class prediction of severity levels
✅ Change to: Derive severity levels from binary prediction confidence scores:

0.0-0.3: Normal
0.3-0.5: Borderline/Suspect
0.5-0.7: Early Glaucoma
0.7-0.85: Moderate Glaucoma
0.85-0.95: Severe Glaucoma
0.95-1.0: Critical Glaucoma

5. Model Output Layer
❌ Remove: Softmax activation with multiple output neurons
✅ Change to: Sigmoid activation with single output neuron for binary classification
6. Loss Function
❌ Remove: Categorical Crossentropy
✅ Change to: Binary Crossentropy
7. Data Generator Class Mode
❌ Remove: class_mode='categorical'
✅ Change to: class_mode='binary'
8. Input Size Handling
⚠️ Modify: Not all models use 224x224
✅ Add: Model-specific input size dictionary:

InceptionV3, Xception: 299x299
Others: 224x224

9. Training Workflow
⚠️ Add: Separate training scripts from Streamlit app:

train_models.py for training (run offline)
streamlit_app.py only loads pre-trained models
Reason: Training in Streamlit is impractical and slow

10. Model Loading Optimization
⚠️ Add: @st.cache_resource decorator for model loading
Reason: Prevent reloading models on every Streamlit interaction
11. CDR Estimation Disclaimer
⚠️ Modify: CDR values are estimates, not actual measurements
✅ Add: Clear disclaimer that CDR is estimated from confidence, not measured from image
12. Multi-page Structure
⚠️ Add: Use Streamlit multi-page app structure instead of single page:
pages/
├── 1_🏠_Home.py
├── 2_🔬_Prediction.py
├── 3_📊_Comparison.py
├── 4_📈_Analytics.py
└── 5_ℹ️_About.py
Reason: Better UX and organization
